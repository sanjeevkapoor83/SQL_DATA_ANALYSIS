# ðŸ“Š SQL for Data Analysis â€“ Task 4

This repository contains my work for **Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis** as part of my learning/practice project.  
The objective is to use **SQL queries** to extract and analyze data from a structured database.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
- Learn to manipulate and query structured data using SQL.
- Practice SQL operations on a sample database (`CompanyDB`).

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **MySQL** (can also work with PostgreSQL or SQLite with minor syntax changes)
- SQL Editor: MySQL Workbench / VS Code

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used
**Database Name:** `CompanyDB`  
A custom-created company database containing:
- **Departments**
- **Employees**
- **Salaries**
- **Projects**
- **Clients**
- **Attendance**

This dataset is rich enough to cover:
- Basic Queries (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`)
- Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
- Creating Views for analysis
- Query Optimization with Indexes

---

## ðŸ“œ Queries Included
1. **Basic filtering & sorting**  
2. **Group By with aggregates**  
3. **INNER JOIN** for employee-department relation  
4. **LEFT JOIN** for project-client relation  
5. **RIGHT JOIN** for client-project relation  
6. **Subqueries** for advanced filtering  
7. **Aggregate functions** for totals and averages  
8. **View creation** for analysis (`EmployeeSalaryView`)  
9. **Index creation** for query optimization  
10. **Complex multi-join query** for department-level summaries

## ðŸ“· Output
Screenshots of query outputs are included in the `screenshots/` folder.
